# Customer Behavior & Marketing Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and evaluating the impact of marketing strategies using Python-based data analysis. The work is driven by case studies and exploratory analysis, emphasizing data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of real-world customer and marketing scenarios.

The project is developed across multiple phases. Phase 1 concentrates on understanding customer behavior patterns, while Phase 2 examines marketing actions, their effects, and specific case studies. Supporting materials include detailed reports, executable notebooks, and presentations that document the analysis, insights, and conclusions.
